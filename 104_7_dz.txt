Vagrant Documentation
Welcome to the documentation for Vagrant - the command line utility for managing the lifecycle of virtual machines. This website aims to document every feature of Vagrant from top-to-bottom, covering as much detail as possible. If you are just getting started with Vagrant, it is highly recommended that you start with the getting started guide first, and then return to this page.

The navigation will take you through each component of Vagrant. Click on a navigation item to get started, or read more about why developers, designers, and operators choose Vagrant for their needs.

Boxes
Boxes are the package format for Vagrant environments. A box can be used by anyone on any platform that Vagrant supports to bring up an identical working environment.

The vagrant box utility provides all the functionality for managing boxes. You can read the documentation on the vagrant box command for more information.

The easiest way to use a box is to add a box from the publicly available catalog of Vagrant boxes. You can also add and share your own customized boxes on this website.

Boxes also support versioning so that members of your team using Vagrant can update the underlying box easily, and the people who create boxes can push fixes and communicate these fixes efficiently.

You can learn all about boxes by reading this page as well as the sub-pages in the navigation to the left.
